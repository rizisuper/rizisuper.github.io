## About Me 

My name is Rizwan Ali, and I'm almost years old. Compare to other kids, I haven't had that many hardships. Not really. Stuff's happened, sure. But stuff's always happens, right? You can't just quit, life isn't about quitting it's about evolving. But the real challange in my life, the real hardship is me. It's always been me. As long as I remember I've never not been afraid. Afraid of failure, afriad of letting people down, afraid of getting hurt or hurting people. It's actually fine to live in the now, but the best part about now is there's another one tomorrow. Working on the "now" is the best way to live the life how it's ment to.

### Student Life

My life is always on the Move, I completed my startup classes in Hyderabad. Then I left for London, then I came back and now I'm in DHA Suffa University
